# Library-Management-System-LMS-
# 📚 Library Management System

A **Full Stack Library Management System** built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React** for the frontend.
This system allows **administrators to manage books and users**, while **users can search, borrow, and return books easily**.

The application uses **JWT Authentication** to provide secure login and role-based access for **Admin** and **User**.

# 🔐 Authentication

This project uses **JWT (JSON Web Token)** authentication.

Workflow:

1. User/Admin logs in using username and password
2. Backend generates a JWT token
3. Token is stored in browser LocalStorage
4. Token is sent with every API request
5. Backend verifies token before allowing access

---

# 📚 Borrow Book Workflow

1. User logs into the system
2. User searches for books in the library
3. If the book is available, a **Borrow** option is displayed
4. When the user borrows a book:

   * Available book count decreases
   * Borrow record is stored in the database
5. Admin can view borrowing history from the dashboard
